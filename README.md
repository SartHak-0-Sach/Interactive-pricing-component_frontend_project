## Overview

### The challenge

Explore our interactive pricing component and choose the perfect plan for your needs. 

This beautifully designed and responsive frontend component allows users to- 
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See the hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers.
- The component provides pricing options for various page view ranges, with the ability to toggle between monthly and yearly billing for a 25% discount on all prices.

### How to setup the project

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using GitHub Desktop or Git Bash:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SartHak-0-Sach/Interactive-pricing-component_frontend_project.git
   ```
2. Open the project folder in your code editor.
3. Run the project using a live server extension or deploy it using Netlify, Vercel, or another web hosting and deployment service.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### What I learned

This was among the first projects of mine where I applied DOM manipulation using javaScript and changed the style of elements using query selectors and `.style` method to alter according to changes in webpage to make it more dynamic to user according to his/her own needs as shown-

```js
const calculatePrice = (event) => {
    //Change background color for slider
    console.log(+slider.value);
    if (+slider.value === 0) {
        slider.style.backgroundSize = "0% 100%";
    }
    if (+slider.value === 1) {
        slider.style.backgroundSize = "25% 100%";
    }
    if (+slider.value === 2) {
        slider.style.backgroundSize = "50% 100%";
    }
    if (+slider.value === 3) {
        slider.style.backgroundSize = "75% 100%";
    }
    if (+slider.value === 4) {
        slider.style.backgroundSize = "100% 100%";
    }

    viewsEl.textContent = viewsArr[event.target.value];
    if (!checkbox.checked) {
        priceEl.textContent = "$" + monthlyPrices[event.target.value];
    } else {
        let amount = Math.abs(
            monthlyPrices[event.target.value] * 12 * 0.25 -
            monthlyPrices[event.target.value] * 12
        );
        priceEl.textContent = "$" + amount;
    }
};
```

### Continued development

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in javascript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of. 

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.
